    <!-- 1. STRATEGIC CONTEXT -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">1. Strategic context</div>
      <h2>From payment efficiency to payments sovereignty</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        For many years, public debates on payments in advanced economies focused on
        <b>efficiency, innovation and user experience</b>. Over the 2025–2035
        horizon, a complementary narrative has gained prominence: <b>payments
        sovereignty</b>. It reflects concerns that critical parts of the payment
        value chain – from card schemes and messaging networks to cloud-based
        wallets and tokenised deposits – may be heavily concentrated in a small
        number of jurisdictions, providers or technologies.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        In Europe, this discussion intersects with the broader agenda on
        <b>strategic autonomy</b>. It touches on topics such as:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Dependence on non-European schemes and providers:</b> a significant
          share of card and wallet transactions rely on networks, brands and
          infrastructures headquartered outside the EU.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Fragmentation of domestic solutions:</b> national schemes and local
          payment habits coexist with pan-European ambitions, creating a complex
          landscape for merchants, banks and users.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Digital euro and public money in the digital age:</b> discussions on a
          potential digital euro and its infrastructure are often linked to
          resilience, competition and sovereignty concerns.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Industry initiatives:</b> projects such as pan-European solutions,
          instant payments and shared wallets illustrate attempts by market
          participants to build more integrated payment infrastructures.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        Under this lens, <b>PaymentsSovereignty.com</b> is a suitable label for a
        neutral observatory, framework or knowledge hub describing how payments

      <div class="section-tag">2. Descriptive view of “payments sovereignty”</div>
      <h2>Definition and scope</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Without prescribing any official definition, “payments sovereignty” can be
        used descriptively to refer to the <b>ability of a jurisdiction or
        community to ensure secure, resilient, competitive and trustworthy
        payment services</b>, under governance arrangements aligned with its legal
        order and public-interest objectives.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        A pragmatic working scope often includes:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Infrastructure:</b> payment systems, card and account-to-account

          as digital wallets and related technical rails.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Governance:</b> rulebooks, supervisory frameworks, access rules,
          oversight, cooperation structures and the allocation of decision-making
          power between jurisdictions and stakeholders.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Resilience:</b> business continuity, cyber security, operational
          resilience, redundancy and crisis management capabilities, including in
          cross-border settings.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Data and localisation:</b> where critical payment data, messaging,

        <div class="chip">
          <b>Innovation and competition:</b> the ability of domestic and regional

        Using <b>PaymentsSovereignty.com</b> as a banner does not mean that one

    <!-- 3. EUROPE'S DEPENDENCY SURFACE -->

      <div class="section-tag">3. Dependency surface</div>
      <h2>Understanding dependencies in payment infrastructures</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        In many jurisdictions, and particularly in Europe, the payment landscape
        relies on a combination of <b>domestic</b>, <b>regional</b> and
        <b>global</b> infrastructures. Payments sovereignty debates typically focus
        on the following dependency axes:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Schemes and brands:</b> dependence on a limited number of global card
          brands and wallet ecosystems, which may be subject to extraterritorial
          rules or strategic choices not fully controlled by local authorities.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Network and messaging:</b> reliance on specific network providers,
          protocols and messaging standards for cross-border transactions.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Cloud and infrastructure providers:</b> use of cloud services and
          infrastructure components operated under foreign legal jurisdictions.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Tokenisation and credentials:</b> token-based payments, credential
          storage and device-level security tied to proprietary platforms.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Standards and rulebooks:</b> rulemaking and standardisation processes
          that may be dominated by a subset of market participants or jurisdictions.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        A neutral observatory operating under <b>PaymentsSovereignty.com</b> could
        document such dependencies in a factual manner, without assigning blame or
        promoting a specific policy response.

    <!-- 4. INSTITUTIONAL TRAJECTORY -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">4. Institutional trajectory</div>
      <h2>Public initiatives and industry responses</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Payments sovereignty is not a single project. It emerges from the
        combination of public policies, central bank initiatives and private
        sector strategies. Examples often discussed include:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Instant payments and SEPA evolution:</b> efforts to make instant

        <div class="chip">
          <b>Pan-European solutions:</b> industry initiatives aiming to provide
          European-wide payment solutions that complement or compete with global

        <div class="chip">
          <b>Digital euro discussions:</b> explorations of a potential digital euro

      <p class="muted">
        PaymentsSovereignty.com does not belong to any such initiative and does

      <h2>A five-dimension view of payments sovereignty</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Without creating a standard or index, it can be useful to organise the
        discussion around a small number of dimensions. A simple descriptive
        framework for payments sovereignty could include:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Infrastructure:</b> robustness, reach and controllability of payment

          <b>Governance:</b> transparency and balance of decision-making, including
          oversight, rulemaking, dispute resolution and stakeholder representation.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Data:</b> storage, processing and access to critical payment data,
          including localisation, encryption and auditability.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Interoperability:</b> ability to interconnect domestic, regional and

        <div class="chip">
          <b>Crisis-readiness:</b> capacity to maintain essential payment services

      <h2>Outline of a “Payments Sovereignty Index” (illustrative only)</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Some observers may wish to summarise payments sovereignty in the form of
        an index or set of indicators. Under a neutral banner such as
        <b>PaymentsSovereignty.com</b>, this can be approached cautiously and

        <div class="chip">
          Distinguish between <b>domestic control</b> (legal and operational) and

      <p class="muted">
        The ecosystem around payments sovereignty involves public authorities,
        payment schemes, banks, fintechs, technology providers and civil society.
        Each has legitimate perspectives but also commercial or institutional
        interests. A neutral label such as <b>PaymentsSovereignty.com</b> can
        help:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Signal that the focus is on <b>governance, resilience and public

        <div class="chip">
          Offer a <b>stable home</b> for observatories, background papers,
          frameworks and bibliographies on payments sovereignty, even as
          individual projects start and end.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Provide a <b>single entry point</b> where different policy documents,
